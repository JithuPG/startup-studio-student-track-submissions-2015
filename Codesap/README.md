## Problem Statement

> Write a program which when given links to two images on the Internet, finds out how similar they are. Bonus points if it ranks images on a similarity scale from 0 - very different to 100 - exactly the same.

### The program

HTML5 Canvas based image similarity detection. Drag and drop files in the drop zones to perform the image comparision. Instantly computes and returns the similarity value as a percentage value (0 being least similar and 100 being exactly similar images)

### Try it out!
