# Hello!
This is a repo that hosts Startup Studio Student Track submissions for 2015.

Some interesting stats:
- Most popular Language used was Java, and then Python, 
- Only one person submitted through Bitbucket. Everybody else used Github. Lots of folks interestingly submitted via gists.
- A super majority is studying in the 8th (and last) semester.
